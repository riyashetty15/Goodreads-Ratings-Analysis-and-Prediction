# Goodreads Ratings Analysis and Prediction: Unveiling Trends and Building a Predictive Model
### Overview
In this project, I explored the Goodreads dataset to uncover patterns in book ratings, reader behavior, and publication trends. I derived meaningful insights by combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Univariate Analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Regression and built a model to predict book ratings. I used the `ggplot2` library to create visualizations that helped me understand the data better and communicate the results effectively.

### Key Insights
**Relationship Between Rating Count and Average Rating:**
I observed that books with higher rating counts tend to have an average rating of around 4, while books with fewer ratings show more variability.
<br>
**Preferred Book Length:**
Books with 200â€“400 pages seem to be the sweet spot for readers, as these receive the highest number of ratings.
<br>
**Top Authors:**
Authors like Stephen King, P.G. Wodehouse, Rumiko Takahashi, Orson Scott Card, and Agatha Christie consistently received high ratings, likely due to their enduring popularity and long-standing literary contributions.
<br>
**Publisher Ratings:**
Highly rated publishers often cater to a smaller, highly satisfied audience, which boosts their ratings.
<br>
**Inverse Trends in Reviews and Publications:**
I noticed that authors with the highest average ratings typically have fewer total reviews and publish fewer books over the years, and vice versa.
<br>
**Text Reviews vs. Ratings:**
There seems to be little correlation between the number of text reviews and the overall quantity of ratings. Even books with many reviews may not necessarily have high ratings.

### Analysis Techniques
**Univariate Data Analysis:** I used univariate analysis to study individual variables like book ratings, publication years, and review counts. This helped me understand their distributions, detect outliers, and identify trends.
<br>
**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** To simplify the dataset and highlight key relationships, I performed PCA. This allowed me to identify the most important variables influencing book ratings and uncover hidden patterns in the data.

### Visualizations
Using the `ggplot2` library, I created eight visualizations that showcased:
<br>

- Rating distributions.
- Trends across different page ranges.
- The popularity of top authors and publishers.
- Relationships between variables like publication year, reviews, and ratings.

### Conclusion
This project allowed me to dive deep into the Goodreads dataset, uncover fascinating trends, and build a reliable predictive model. The insights I gained have practical implications for publishing strategies and improving user experience on the Goodreads platform. It was an exciting opportunity to blend data analysis and machine learning to solve a real-world problem.
